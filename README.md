# Welcome Genome Campus hackathon, Hinxton, United Kingdom

Website: [here](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/innovations/hackathon2018)

I chose to compete in the Medicine Discovery Catapultâ€™s challenge:
*How can we combine drug and genetic data to intelligently prescribe drugs?*

The code we came up with as a team is located [here](https://github.com/JPFrancoia/WCG_hackathon)

Note: not all the code is mine, and the code was written in a *hackathon
spirit*: quick and dirty...
